# FlexMag R-2-R Sputtering System LabVIEW Software - IFW Dresden

## Overview

This project contains the LabVIEW software for the FlexMag Roll-to-Roll Sputtering System at IFW Dresden - Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research. The software was developed by me between 2019 and 2023 at IFW Dresden, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Oliver G. Schmidt and Dr. Ing. Daniil Karnaushenko.

This sputtering system was used in the production of large-area giant magnetoresistive (GMR) thin-film stacks, which consist of 30 metallic Co and Cu bilayers on a 100-meter long polyethylene terephthalate (PET) web foil.
